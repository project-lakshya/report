**Raspberry pi**

Differently used versions of raspberry pi are R-pi zero,
raspberry pi 3+,raspberry pi 3B+ which is the presently used
It has a broadcom microcontroller which is a ARM based processor i.e. ARM Cortex A7 the latest one.
ARM is a company which designs the chip but doesn't manufacture.
It has 40 input output pins, 4 USB ports(one for the power i.e to charge).
It has an audio port,camera connector,HDMI (a mutlimedia interface between board and monitor) for monitor.
It has a micro SD slot which is seen on the backside of the board
to install the operating system using the NOOBS(new out of box software) which is 
the major difference between between arduino and R-pi.

**Comparision between Raspberry pi and Arduino**

**Raspberry pi**                                                      
1. Its processor is faster with a speed of almost 1.2GHz                
2. 64 bit processor implying that it can be used                        
   for ver accurate outputs.
3. More memory because of difference in SRAM and mainly                 
   because of micro SD slot.
4. Power sensitive.If too much power drawn it will reboot               
5. It has an operating system beacuse of which multiple programs can be run at the same 
   time which means it keeps on swapping among different programs very fast.

**Arduino**
1.The speed of its processor is 16MHz only.

 2. 8 bit processor.Not very accurate.  
 
 3.Less memory.
 
 4.Major advantage is it is not sensitive to all this.
 
 5.Single program can be run.

**Benifits of Operating system**
R-pi gives a user interface which is not the case with arduino.
We can interact and make changes without writing code everytime to carryout an operation.
Text user and graphic user interface are the 2 types.
In text interface after the prompt on the screen we just have to write our commands for the desired output.
And there are device drivers which act as translator between hardware device and operating system that use it.

**Overclocking**

Different parts of the chip run at different frequency.
Overclocking is the process of increasing the clock frequency i.e time taken to reach the next clock edge is reduced.

# Linux

***Text user interface***
Shell-It reads the user input and displays on the screen.
BASH-default shell for Raspian.
man pwd gives the information about a command like how to use it.
Linux filesystem is a hierarchy of directories(it simply means folder).

**Commands**

pwd-current directory location
cd-change directory
Ls-contents of the directory
ls-l -details about all the directories under a current directory
mkdir-creates a directory
rmdir-removes a directory
sudo-root permission to a command
ps-gives all the processes being performed
kill-kills the process
shutdown

**Creating and accesing a file**

Using text editor and nano
cat-to print contents in file
head,body-to print the first and last 10 lines of the file
cp-copy(takes 2 arguments)
mv-move

**File permissions**

R,W,X-read ,write ,execute
Permissions for user refers to owner
group refers to group of people
others refers to everyone else

***Graphical user interface***

startx-to start the GUI window system
